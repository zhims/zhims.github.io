 Mathematics encompasses the study of topics such as number theory, algebra, geometry, and mathematical analysis. Despite its vast scope and importance, mathematics does not have a universally agreed-upon definition. It is a discipline focused on abstract structures, logical reasoning, and the relationships between quantities, spaces, and patterns. The subject's flexibility allows for various interpretations, depending on the specific branch or approach used to explore mathematical concepts.
