Work is just a part of life, and life should be rich and fulfilling. Though there are many things I want to achieve in my career, I sometimes feel limited by my lack of natural talent. Nevertheless, I have a strong passion for mathematics and am committed to putting in the hard work, even if it means focusing on small tasks. Recently, I have been mainly working on projects related to the materials provided below. Despite the challenges, I continue to dedicate myself to learning and improving my skills, knowing that persistence and effort will lead to progress.
