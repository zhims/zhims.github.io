Codes are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming, serving as a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. They are written in various programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++, each with its own syntax and rules. Codes can range from simple commands to complex algorithms, enabling software applications, websites, and systems to function. Writing efficient, clear, and well-documented code is crucial for ensuring the performance, maintainability, and scalability of programs. With the advancement of technology, mastering coding has become an essential skill in today's digital world.
