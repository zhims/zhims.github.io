Quantum refers to the smallest discrete unit of any physical property, often associated with energy or matter. In physics, quantum mechanics is the theory that explains the behavior of matter and energy at microscopic scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles.

Unlike classical physics, which operates on deterministic principles, quantum mechanics introduces key concepts like superposition, allowing particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously, and entanglement, which describes how particles can become interconnected regardless of distance. The implications of quantum theory are profound, leading to groundbreaking advancements in various fields, including information technology, chemistry, and materials science. For instance, quantum computing utilizes these principles to process information at unprecedented speeds, potentially revolutionizing computational power.
