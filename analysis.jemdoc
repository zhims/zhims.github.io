 Mathematical analysis is a branch of mathematics that focuses on continuous functions, limits, differentiation, integration, and related theories. It evolved from calculus and is studied within the context of real and complex numbers.

The historical roots of analysis can be traced back to ancient Greek mathematicians, notably Archimedes and Eudoxus. Its formal development began in the 17th century with the contributions of Fermat and Descartes, leading to the independent creation of calculus by Newton and Leibniz. In the 18th century, Euler introduced the concept of a mathematical function, and Cauchy established rigorous definitions of continuity and sequences. The 19th century brought further advancements, including Dedekind's construction of real numbers and Lebesgue's integration theory, which refined Riemann's approach. Today, modern analysis has expanded into functional analysis, complex analysis, and measure theory, laying the foundation for numerous fields in mathematics and its applications.
