= Yao Zhang - Magnetohydrodynamics, MHD
\n
Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is the study of the behavior of electrically conducting fluids--such as plasmas, liquid metals, or saltwater--in the presence of magnetic fields. MHD combines principles from both fluid dynamics and electromagnetism, exploring how these two aspects interact. It is an important field in astrophysics, engineering, and fusion research.
