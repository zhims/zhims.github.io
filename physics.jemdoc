Physics seeks to understand nature across a vast range of scales, from fundamental particles to large-scale cosmic structures. At the microscopic level, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory describe matter, forces, and fields, while special relativity governs high-velocity phenomena. On larger scales, general relativity provides the framework for gravity, enabling the study of compact objects and gravitational wave astrophysics. In astrophysical environments, radiative and dynamical processes determine how energy and momentum are transported through matter and fields. These principles come together in areas such as solar physics, where plasma, radiation, and magnetic dynamics interact in complex, multiscale systems.
