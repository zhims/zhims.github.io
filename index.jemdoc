==  Biography
Yao Zhang was born in a rural village near Weishan Lake in northwestern Jiangsu, China, where he spent both his childhood and teenage years, completing his primary and secondary education. Upon graduating from high school, he relocated to Shenzhen, China, where he went on to earn both his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Mathematics at Shenzhen University in June 2014 and June 2019, respectively. During this time, from July 2014 to June 2016, he worked at a semiconductor company near Lihu Lake in Wuxi, while also managing a side business by running a street stall. In the fall of 2022, he entered a new chapter in his personal life when he married a doctor. Continuing his academic journey, in September 2024, he successfully completed his Ph.D. in Astronomy at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences under the supervision of Dr. Long Xu. Before embarking on his Ph.D., he gained valuable research experience, spending a year as a research assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
# He is now looking forward to starting a new position at a research institution.

. Maxwell's Equations: ~ $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}, \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0, \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}, \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$. ~ They describe the interaction between the electric field $\mathbf{E}$, magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, and charge distribution.

. Schr$ \mathop{\rm o}\limits^{\text{..}} $dinger Equation: ~ $i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi$, ~ where $\psi$ is the wave function, and $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, describing the energy state of the system.
\n
. Einstein Field Equations: ~  $R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}$, ~ where $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Ricci tensor, $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric tensor, and $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the energy-momentum tensor. 
\n
. Navier-Stokes Equations: ~ $\rho\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}$. ~ These equations encompass the conservation of mass and momentum, and describe external force effects.
